Tropical Depression 23W was a weak tropical system that brought torrential rainfall and extreme flooding over northern and central Vietnam. 23W formed as a weak tropical depression on October 7, located to the northwest of Luzon. The system moved in a general westward direction as it steadily intensified. Despite it being forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm, 23W failed to reach that intensity due to lack of organisation as it made landfall over the Hà Tĩnh Province on October 10.

As of October 13, a total of 54 people were confirmed dead while damage losses were up to at least 225 billion₫ (US$10.0 million).

On October 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring on a weak tropical depression that had developed about 125 km (78 mi) to the northwest of Manila, Philippines.[1] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), however, remained its classification as a tropical disturbance, with a "medium" chance of developing into a tropical cyclone.[2] By 10:00 UTC of October 8, the JTWC had issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert,[3] while the JMA had determined that the system had winds of 55 km/h (35 mph).[4] Several hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories and upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving the designation of 23W.[5] The JMA followed suit on issuing advisories three hours later on October 9.[6]
Impact

Despite being a weak system, 23W caused severe impacts in many provinces across northern Vietnam. Rainfall was recorded in amounts of 100–150 mm (3.9–5.9 in) over in the northern and central portion of the country, especially to the provinces of Nghe An and Ha Tinh. Many hydroelectric dams and lakes have to be discharged and the Ministry of Industry and Trade has established a working group to ensure safeties of 31 hydroelectric lakes.[7] Heavy rainfall had contributed to flash flooding, where five people have been swept away with an additional five injured over in the district of Tram Tau. Rescue efforts had saved 28 people from the "danger zone".[8] About 740 houses have been flooded, with 30 being fully destroyed. The forces mobilized up to 2,200 people, including the military, police, youth union and civil defense offices, accompanied by a variety of means to search for missing victims, as well as support the people in the area. Moreover the Red River (Asia) was forecast to reach water levels of 3–50 cm (1.2–19.7 in).[8]

On October 12, a landslide occurred over in a district in Hoa Binh, which buried four households.[9] The amount of flooded houses have risen to 16,700. More than 39,300 hectares of crops were damaged along with two dikes. 1,200 cattle and roughly 40,000 fowls have either been killed or swept away from flooding or landslides.[9] Rainfall over in Mai Châu District has reached 390 mm (15.3 in), while Kim Bôi District had a total of 450 mm (17.7 in). Lương Sơn district had 13 hectares of rice damaged along with 97 hectares of other agriculture crops and 7 hectares of fruit trees. 6 km of roads and 4 km of canal were also damaged due to the flooding.[10] The Vietnam Red Cross offered abut 250 million₫ (US$11 thousand) to families affected from a landslide in Phú Cường.[11]

Damage losses from Yen Bai province were counted at 120 billion₫ (US$5.28 million),[12] while Son La had 59 billion₫ (US$2.6 million)[13] and Phu Tho had 22.8 billion₫ (US$1 million).[14] Lương Sơn district had damages reaching 25 billion₫ (US$1.12 million),[10] and Lac Son had damages of about 16 billion₫ (US$700 thousand).[15] and Lac Son had damages of about 16 billion₫ (US$700 thousand).[15] As of October 13, there has been 54 people dead while 39 are still missing.[16] Most of the fatalities were recorded from the district of Hoa Binh with a total of 13.
